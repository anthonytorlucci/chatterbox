My primary use for generative ai leveraging large language models is for scientific research and code development.
While today's llm models are quite adept at solving most problems, I often would like to feed research articles and/or open source projects to the llm for additional context. Many of those research articles are likely outside the scope of the llm's training data.

Chatterbox is a collection langgraph workflows (graphs) made up of components (nodes, conditional edges, and utilities). Each workflow has an associated frontend web application built with Streamlit.

Early days still....
