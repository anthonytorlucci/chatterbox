My primary use for generative ai leveraging large language models is for research and code development.
While today's llm models are quite adept at solving most problems, I often would like to feed research
articles and/or open source projects to the llm for additional context.

Chatterbox is a streamlit web application that uses the "Plan and Execute" approach to agentic rag.
